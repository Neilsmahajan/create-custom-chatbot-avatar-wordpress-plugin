# Create Custom Chatbot Avatar WordPress Plugin

This project provides a web application that allows Christine's clients to generate a customized WordPress AI chatbot avatar plugin for their websites. Each client can personalize the chatbot plugin by inputting their own **Knowledge Base**, **Predefined Questions**, **Avatar Selection**, and **Language Preference**. The web application then generates a `chatbot.php` file tailored to the client's needs, which can be deployed directly into their WordPress site.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Customization**: Clients can input specific knowledge related to their business or company for chatbot responses.
- **Predefined Questions**: Allows input of frequently asked questions for quick and automated responses.
- **Avatar Selection**: Clients can choose from a set of predefined avatars or upload their own image for the chatbot.
- **Language Preference**: Supports English and Canadian French. The chatbot's prompts and text-to-speech features will adapt based on the specified language in the shortcode.
- **Custom Plugin Generation**: Automatically creates a customized `chatbot.php` plugin for WordPress.
- **Shortcode-Based Deployment**: Clients can manually specify the language using a shortcode and add the chatbot to specific pages.
