# Create Custom Chatbot Avatar WordPress Plugin

This project provides a web application that allows Christine's clients to generate a customized WordPress AI chatbot avatar plugin for their websites. Each client can personalize the chatbot plugin by inputting their own **Knowledge Base**, **Predefined Questions**, **Avatar Selection**, and **Language Preference**. The web application then generates a `chatbot.php` file tailored to the client's needs, which can be deployed directly into their WordPress site.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Customization**: Clients can input specific knowledge related to their business or company for chatbot responses.
- **Predefined Questions**: Allows input of frequently asked questions for quick and automated responses.
- **Avatar Selection**: Clients can choose from a set of predefined avatars or upload their own image for the chatbot.
- **Language Preference**: Supports English and Canadian French. The chatbot's prompts and text-to-speech features will adapt based on the selected language.
- **Custom Plugin Generation**: Automatically creates a customized `chatbot.php` plugin for WordPress.

## Example Workflow

### For a Real Estate Client:

1. Knowledge Base:
   ```
   "You are a helpful assistant for a real estate business. Provide information about available properties, buying/selling processes, and mortgage options."
2. Predefined Questions:
   ```
   "What are the current real estate trends in the city?"
   "How can I find the perfect home for my family?"
   "What is the process for selling my property?"
   ```
3. Avatar Selection: Upload a custom image of a professional real estate agent.
4. Language Preference: Canadian French

The generated plugin will contain these customizations and provide a tailored experience on their WordPress site.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the user interface, with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.
- **Backend:** PHP scripts handle data processing, avatar uploads, and dynamic plugin generation.
- **WordPress Integration:** The generated chatbot.php file uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for chatbot and voice interactions.

### Template Placeholders in chatbot.php

The backend replaces these placeholders in the template with the client's input:
- {{KNOWLEDGE_BASE}}: The knowledge base provided by the client.
- {{PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS}}: The predefined questions provided by the client.
- {{LANGUAGE}}: The language preference provided by the client.
- {{AVATAR}}: The avatar image provided by the client.
